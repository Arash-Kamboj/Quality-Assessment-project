------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is regarding a giant beverage company. Being a quality analyst, my primary object is to assess the production lines and keep them in check over the time to meet the industrial standards. The organisation keeps track of every move of the production lines for instance, the timings, quantity of beverages, etc. 
I am tasked with checking if different production lines are pouring the right amount of beverages with proper carbonation in a predefined time. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Objective: To explore the assessment data and provide relevant insights. By transforming these insights into practical strategies, the company can make significant strides in improving the assembly lines and therefore the production.

Problem statement: To reiterate, the company aims to optimise the workings of production lines. To accomplish this goal, I need to understand extremes, patterns and associations with applications of probability and distributions.
